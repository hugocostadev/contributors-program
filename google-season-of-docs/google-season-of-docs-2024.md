## Project ideas

### Main Project Developer Documentation Audit and update  

#### The Problem

Rocket.Chat, as an open-source communication platform, faces unique challenges in maintaining and enhancing its documentation to meet the dynamic needs of its diverse developer community. The existing documentation, while comprehensive, has been identified to have several areas needing improvement to better serve the project’s contributors, developer experience, and the community’s growing demands.
Every day new contributors post questions about Development setup, contribution, and project best practices and this could lead some of them to give up contributing due to the lack of documentation in certain areas.

**Existing documentation page:** [https://developer.rocket.chat](https://developer.rocket.chat)

### Project scope

* Check and analyze GitHub issues, forums, and community channel data to find the areas to improve the main project documentation
* Update main project documentation homepage with resources and fast links for most visited pages
* Reorganize documentation structure to better-fit contributor needs and interests
* Rewrite and improve Contribution guidelines and How to start contributing
* Update the [Server (main project) Repository Structure](https://developer.rocket.chat/open-source-projects/server/repository-structure) documentation with current structure and packages explanations
* Improve troubleshooting for the most common scenarios and systems that are reported in the community channels (GitHub, forum, and open channel)
* Create a How to guide to:
  * Write unit and end-to-end test
  * Write front-end code
  * Write back-end code
  * Contribute to Internationalization/translations
  * Deploy Rocket.Chat with different methods (Docker, snap, etc...)

### Out of scope

* Tech writers won't develop and change the github project structure
* Tech writers won't be implementing new tools

### How would we measure success?

* Reduction in github issues related to contributor onboarding and environment setup issues
* Reduction in the number of open questions found in our public channels
* Increase in pull request numbers to the main project
* Increased coverage of well-known contributor pain points

### Apps development Documentation Audit and update  

#### The Problem

Developing apps to enhance Rocket.Chat's functionality offers a more straightforward approach than delving into its extensive code base. However, there's a noticeable gap in the documentation available for app developers.

Navigating our current documentation proves challenging for newcomers to app development. The available information lacks the necessary detail and clarity, turning what could be an efficient development process into a protracted and sometimes discouraging experience. This scenario often leads to developers feeling overwhelmed, potentially causing them to abandon their projects entirely.

Presently, app development for Rocket.Chat can be daunting without direct assistance from seasoned app developers or our internal team.

**Existing documentation page:** [https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/rocket.chat-apps-engine](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/rocket.chat-apps-engine)

### Project scope

* Check and analyze GitHub issues, forums, and community channel data to find the areas to improve the main project documentation
* Update outdated information about the Apps.Engine
* Create rich How to guides with images and source code to:
  * Create a slash command app
  * Call external APIs
  * Use UI elements to interact with the user or app
  * Handle permissions
  * Add a configurations page to your app
  * Persist data
  * Add internationalization to your app
  * Register API endpoint
  * OAuth with external applications
  * Schedule tasks that run in a defined period
  * Debug your app
  * Publish the app in the Rocket.Chat marketplace

### Out of scope

* Tech writers won't develop and change the github project structure
* Tech writers won't be implementing new tools

### How would we measure success?

* Reduction in github issues related app develpoment
* Reduction in the number of open questions found in our public community server and Forum
* Increased apps published in the marketplace
* Increased documentation visits
